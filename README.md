# substring_highlight
Highlight text at the letter-level.  Designed for search-term highlighting, a single search sub-string is highlighted (perhaps multiple tiimes) within a longer string.    Like the existing package "highlight_text," but highlights sub-word character matches ('t' in 'Peter'), and only supports a single search term.   Does NOT currently support clickable highlights.
