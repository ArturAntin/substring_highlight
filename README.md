# substring_highlight

Highlight text at the letter-level.  Designed for search-term highlighting, a single search sub-string is highlighted (perhaps multiple tiimes) within a longer string.    Like the existing package &quot;highlight_text,&quot; but highlights sub-word character matches (&#x27;t&#x27; in &#x27;Peter&#x27;), and only supports a single search term.   Does NOT currently support clickable highlights.

Here is an example:
